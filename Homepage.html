      <h1>A Zondle-esque studying experince, specifically designed for my LA class</h1>
      <p>When Zondle went down I decided to build this website with these games for my classmates to study as usual</p>

    <h2>To Study</h2>
    <p>When my teacher announced that Zondle wouldn't be available after this test, I decided to make a parody of Zondle.<br>
    Zondle was very affective for me and my classmates to study with, especially for our Word of the Day Quizzes. The games <br> aren't
    generally very visually pleasing so I didn't think it would be very hard. I also thought that it was likely that I could <br>
    find the games source code for free so it would be especially easy to make some of the games. I am starting out with making <br>
    popular "Dodge the meteors in a spaceship" first, for a couple reasons: It is very popular; It doesn't use complicated <br>
    images or movement; and finally it would be relatively easy to recreate. To be completely honest I will admit part of the<br>
    reason I am so intent on making this is because it will look great in a portfolio.</p>
